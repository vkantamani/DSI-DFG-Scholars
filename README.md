DSI Scholars Program - Project Lead

As a part of a Data Science Institute (DSI) Scholars Program “Data for Good” project, I lead a team of student researchers in coordination with sociological research teams from the Fundación por la Educación Multidimensional (FEM) in Colombia to orchestrate projects ensuring land access and legal representation to underrepresented indigenous groups in Colombia.

I documented and implemented new frameworks for data collection and analysis procedures used in census surveys of rural indigenous communities (e.g. source-to-target mapping of household socioeconomic data). I executed data visualization and predictive analytics projects using Tableau, R, and Python 3 to determine land usage trends to identify communities requiring FEM support, and to demonstrate inaccuracies in government representation of public land data.

I developed a project proposal for a GIS mapping project of Colombian titled public land to facilitate FEM’s goal of connecting local communities with the technical and legal resources to protect their cultural lands and territories.
